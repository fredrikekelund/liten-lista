# Notes
## Fredrik Ekelund, 2013

A tiny experiment/exercise where I dabble with a few technologies - namely Yeoman (for scaffolding), therefore also NPM and even more Bower for package management, Grunt for lovely, automated development task management, SASS/Compass for CSS preprocessing (with which I'm already familiar, though) and knockout.js for MV(VM) Javascript structure. Possibly also CoffeeScript soon enough.
