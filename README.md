A tiny experiment/exercise in which I dabble with a few technologies - namely Yeoman (for scaffolding and opinionated workflow), NPM & Bower for package management, Grunt for lovely, automated development task management, SASS/Compass for CSS preprocessing (with which I'm already familiar, though), knockout.js for MV(VM) Javascript structure and CoffeeScript.
